# Various Implementations of QPE.
## Team: Quantum Bugs: Diogo Cruz, Federico Pantin, Tulsi Chaudhari, Ben Kamen, Nishan Choutaje Jayarama
Quantum Phase estimation(QPE) is an important subroutine in several quantum algorithms finding their place in condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry, factoring and many more. We present a few implementations of the QPE algorithm namely iterative QPE, Bayesian QPE and also the novel $\alpha-$QPE which gives us an avenue for optimizition over the number of measurements done and the circuit depth. We have attempted to implement these algorithms on a test unitary similar to the [example notebook](https://github.com/iQuHACK/2024_planning_quantinuum/blob/main/challenge_resources/phase_estimation_challenge.ipynb), and also to unitary evolution of [Pauli string Hamiltonians](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.16608.pdf).
